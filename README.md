# 2024-CS151-07-BlackPython-Snakes.Game-Manager

This project involves implementing a Blackjack and Snake game system in JavaFX. 
We will be using splitting each game into its own file, which will then be handled 
by a GameManager class to run the application. Users can create a login and have 
their high scores saved in the game's records.
